In the coming modules, we will be doing various tasks to analyze and make predictions on allotted selected company stock. You
may need to learn about the underlying markets as well to complete the internship.
Below, there is a dropdown of various industries for you to chose from. Browse through all of them and choose the industry of
your liking and submit.
On doing so, you'll be allotted a company belonging to the industry you chose and a 'csv' file will be downloaded.
Once allotted, the company stock or the industry cannot be changed, so choose the industry wisely !
Once the stock is allotted, you'd be married to it for the course of this project, from exploratory analysis to accurate future
predictions and trade/invest calls!
